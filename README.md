# RE_TT_prediction_HBR
Travel time prediction with generalized Bayesian regression with varying coefficients

The repo also contains tree-based models (NGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest) implemented to compare the performance of hierarchical Bayesian Regression (HBR) model with these highly expressible models.
